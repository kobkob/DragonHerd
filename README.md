### **Colophon**

Dragonflies belong to one of the oldest insect orders, the Odonata, which has existed for over 320 million years. They are fascinating and highly effective predators of bugs throughout their lives, both in their aquatic larval stage and as winged adults.

#### *As Nymphs (Larvae):*

Dragonfly nymphs spend the majority of their lives underwater, which can range from a few months to several years depending on the species and environmental conditions. They are fearsome aquatic predators, often camouflaged to blend in with their surroundings. Their primary hunting tool is a unique, hinged lower jaw called a labium, which is typically folded under their head. When prey comes within range, the labium shoots out with incredible speed, snatching the unsuspecting victim and pulling it back to the nymph's mouth. Dragonfly nymphs feed on a variety of aquatic invertebrates, including insect larvae (like mosquito larvae), small crustaceans, worms, snails, leeches, and even small fish and tadpoles. Some larger species have even been observed engaging in cannibalism when resources are scarce. They are crucial components of the aquatic food web, acting as both predators and prey for larger marine animals, such as fish and birds.

#### *As Adults:*

Once they emerge from the water and transform into their winged adult form, dragonflies become aerial acrobats and highly successful hunters. They are among the most efficient predators in the animal kingdom, with a hunting success rate that can reach up to 95%. This incredible success is attributed to their exceptional vision, lightning-fast reflexes, and unparalleled aerial maneuverability.

* **Vision:** Dragonflies possess enormous compound eyes that provide nearly 360-degree vision and are composed of up to 30,000 facets. These eyes have specialized zones for different tasks, including a dorsal acute zone for tracking prey against the sky and a frontal acute zone for focusing on targets. They can see in a broad spectrum of colors, including UV light, and have an incredible ability to detect movement. They also have specialized neurons that allow them to focus on a single target even within a swarm of other insects, effectively filtering out distractions.  
* **Flight:** Dragonflies can move each of their four wings independently, giving them extraordinary control. They can hover, fly backward, turn on a dime, and achieve high speeds (up to 30 mph). When hunting, they employ a technique called "motion camouflage," where they fly a path that makes them appear stationary to their prey, allowing them to approach undetected. They also demonstrate predictive hunting, anticipating their prey's movements and flying to an interception point rather than simply chasing after them.  
* **Hunting Technique:** Adult dragonflies catch their prey in mid-air, using their bristly legs to form a basket that scoops up the insect. They primarily prey on other flying insects such as flies, midges, mosquitoes, butterflies, moths, and even smaller dragonflies. Once caught, they often carry their meal to a perch to consume it.

The entire life cycle of a dragonfly, from egg to adult, can span several years, with most of that time spent in the predatory nymph stage. The adult stage, though shorter (typically a few weeks to a couple of months), is also characterized by constant hunting to fuel their active lifestyle.
